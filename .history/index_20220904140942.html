You are in t<span class="SecSec">he process of implementing new CRM Software. The software is anticipated to increase sales, improve customer service, and more efficiently automate current processes. You’ve brought in an SME to train your employees on the new system.

One employee, Sandy, is resistant the change. She has been vocal about her dislike of the new system and her disbelief that it will improve processes. Sandy is your direct report and has worked with the company for 10 years as a salesperson. You have a good relationship with Sandy and have not had performance issues with her since you started as manager.

As Sandy’s coach, help her navigate a challenging change and give her the tools she needs to be successful through it. Support her from being a resistor of change to some one who can see the benefits of the change and the positive impact it can bring.</span><span class="readMore" title="Click to Show More"> Read More...</span><span class="readLess" title="Click to Show Less"> Read Less</span></p><div class="elementor-button-wrapper"><a class="elementor-button elementor-size-sm add_to_cart" data-pid="26" role="button"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> Purchase $285.00</a></div></div><div class="sclmn-three"><img height="290" width="590" src="https://simpactv2.danneundorf.com/storage/sls_uploads/A5JgMK6umasQqGGXnlTa8k7oY6uTwpTkVQeGYNWD.jpg"><h3 class="simu-title">Coaching for Communicating with Clarity</h3><p class="addReadMore showlesscontent">You run a growing organization and have several managers reporting to you, <span class="SecSec">each with a team of 12-15 people. One manager, Paulo’s team has struggled with the last project they worked on. It was not completed on time or to expectations. You’re aware of this already, and have spoken with Paulo, who told you he addressed the issues at his last team meeting. Now, team member Angela has expressed to you that she feels frustrated in her role and unsure of expectations. Angela asserts that Paulo addressed the team as a whole and said they are not performing but has not provided her any individual feedback that her performance needs improvement.

You feel it’s necessary to have a conversation with Paulo to hear his side of things. You will have to approach this conversation from a supportive and curious lens, as you have not directly observed what Angela has experienced. You will need to coach Paulo through this performance issue with his team knowing that his communication skills may be playing a role.</span><span class="readMore" title="Click to Show More"> Read More...</span><span class="readLess" title="Click to Show Less"> Read Less</span></p><div class="elementor-button-wrapper"><a class="elementor-button elementor-size-sm add_to_cart" data-pid="27" role="button"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> Purchase $285.00</a></div></div><div class="sclmn-three"><img height="290" width="590" src="https://simpactv2.danneundorf.com/storage/sls_uploads/NgdcaAo4G7xXSm5aDryxQ6GTsig11NelJ2Bq6lxl.jpg"><h3 class="simu-title">Coaching to Resolve Conflict</h3><p class="addReadMore showlesscontent">Glen is new employee in your organization. He is having a conflict with his<span class="SecSec"> colleague, Sam, and it is escalating. Glen corrected Sam on some analytics he was presenting in a team meeting during Glen’s first week with the company, and there has been consistent tension between him and Sam ever since. On occasion Glen has asked Sam for help with a project, and Sam has either failed to reply or claimed he is too busy with his own tasks. When Glen and Sam are assigned a task to work on together, Sam disagrees with almost every idea Glen puts forth which almost always leads to an argument.

You have noticed Glen now seems to avoid Sam and attempts to figure out areas he is unsure of on his own. You appreciate the initiative, but it has resulted in some mistakes and missed deadlines. The risk of negative lasting effects of the conflict between Glen and Sam seems imminent.

Coaching Glen will require you to show both empathy and candor, while helping him to understand the potential negative impact of the conflict on his reputation. You know you will have to guide him on the best ways to resolve the conflict while dealing with all the emotions it brings.</span><span class="readMore" title="Click to Show More"> Read More...</span><span class="readLess" title="Click to Show Less"> Read Less</span></p><div class="elementor-button-wrapper"><a class="elementor-button elementor-size-sm add_to_cart" data-pid="28" role="button"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> Purchase $285.00</a></div></div><div class="sclmn-three"><img height="290" width="590" src="https://simpactv2.danneundorf.com/storage/sls_uploads/xCps577DiqKbDPpdkjxcMSf4DBbDzfdxAoJxcqOP.jpg"><h3 class="simu-title">Coaching for More Engagement</h3><p class="addReadMore showlesscontent">You have noticed that one of your team members, Saira, seems unengaged late<span class="SecSec">ly. Saira has been with the company for a year and to date has been an effective worker. Lately though, she has been missing some deadlines and making mistakes more frequently. When you addressed her on an error she made, she simply said she must have misunderstood the direction, though it was for a task she does regularly. She has been quiet at the last few team meetings.

In order to address Saira’s performance, you will first need to understand the cause of her lack of engagement. Using empathy and tact, coach Saira to be able to verbalize what she is experiencing,then use compromise to find a solution that will increase her engagement.</span><span class="readMore" title="Click to Show More"> Read More...</span><span class="readLess" title="Click to Show Less"> Read Less</span></p><div class="elementor-button-wrapper"><a class="elementor-button elementor-size-sm add_to_cart" data-pid="29" role="button"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> Purchase $285.00</a></div></div><div class="sclmn-three"><img height="290" width="590" src="https://simpactv2.danneundorf.com/storage/sls_uploads/S5qU0f8OPaQU5VfW3vUnnvUYaqLju9VjIOK2w6FU.jpg"><h3 class="simu-title">Coaching for Change using ADKAR</h3>

However, there will need to be some restructuring of positions to reflect the federation’s new position as a service provider across the province. 

You are meeting with your management team to begin the change management process. One manager in particular will struggle with the change more than the others. You need to coach them through this change and to successfully adapt to their modified role using the ADKAR model.</span><span class="readMore" title="Click to Show More"> Read More...</span><span class="readLess" title="Click to Show Less"> Read Less</span></p>

      <p class="addReadMore showlesscontent">As professionals, we are often put on the spot and asked questions that we <span class="SecSec">aren’t always prepared to answer, or feel we can’t answer in the best way without ample time to prepare a good response. Even if we are quick thinkers and are able to pick up and process new ideas quickly, we aren’t always able to respond as quickly as we’d like to.

      Sometimes it’s because we aren’t ready to release information, or it’s simply because we don’t have the answer at the time. As leaders, everyone has worked hard to establish themselves as trustworthy, transparent, and knowledgeable and it is important that we do all we can to maintain that. Preparing yourself to think and respond quickly is a key tool for professionals, and it can be a learned and improved-upon skill that will help you convey confidence when you’re caught off guard.
      
      In this simulation you will learn how to think and respond quickly with excellent responses and renewed confidence.</span><span class="readMore" title="Click to Show More"> Read More...</span><span class="readLess" title="Click to Show Less"> Read Less</span>

We wanted a catchy name that demonstrated the customized nature of our simulations. We use the word Live because learning and skills development happens in real time. You can also partner individually with Dr. Dan – another reason for the word Live.</span></p></div>
